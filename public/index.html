    <h3>Why do I enjoy painting?</h3>
    <p>Painting is a hobby I like to do to relax.</p>
    <p>
      It helps me forget about my stress for a little bit because I'm too busy
      focusing on brush strokes! It helps me turn my brain off and be in the
      moment. It's my form of meditation!
    </p>
    <h3>Other reasons I love to paint:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Presents for friends and family.</li>
      <li>My house is filled with paintings.</li>
      <li>I sell things that I've painted and make money!</li>
